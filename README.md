# HSub
A Haskell-made tiny command line tool to download subtitles from shooter    
用Haskell写的用来去射手网下载字幕的命令行工具。

# Motivation
2 years ago I used C++ to write such tool (SubD: https://github.com/chainone/SubD ) for my NAS to download subtitles automatically when a movie just finishes downloading.     
Right now, as I am learning Haskell, I think that would be interesting if I wrote the same tool using Haskell

# C++ version vs Haskell version
